Key Insights from Bike Purchase Data
1. **Overall Purchase Rate:**
   48.2% of customers purchased a bike, while 51.8% did not.
   The distribution is almost even, with a slight lean toward non-purchasers.

2. **Income and Bike Purchase:**
    Buyers have a slightly higher average income ($57,475) than non-buyers ($55,028).
    The median income for both groups is the same ($60,000).
    This suggests that income alone is not a major deciding factor, though lower-income groups may be less likely to buy.
   
3. **Age Trends:**
     Bike buyers are younger on average (42.8 years) compared to non-buyers (45.3 years).
     The 25th percentile age for buyers is 36 years, while for non-buyers, itâ€™s 35 years.
     Older customers (above 50) are less likely to purchase a bike.
    
4. **Commute Distance Impact:**
     Customers commuting 0-1 miles (54.8%) and 2-5 miles (58.6%) are the most likely to buy bikes.
     Those with long commutes (10+ miles) are the least likely to purchase (only 29.2%).
     This confirms that biking is preferred for short to medium commutes.
     
5. **Occupation Influence:**
   Clerical (50.8%) and Professional (53.6%) workers have the highest bike purchase rates.
   Management roles have the lowest purchase rate (41.95%), suggesting they may rely more on cars or public transport.
   Skilled Manual and Manual laborers are in the mid-range (46%-47%).

6. **Regional Differences:**
   Pacific region has the highest purchase rate (58.9%).
   Europe is balanced (49.3%), while North America has the lowest (43.3%).
   This could indicate stronger biking culture and infrastructure in the Pacific region.
